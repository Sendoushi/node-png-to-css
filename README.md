# PNG to CSS

Just a node script made for fun.
I wouldn't really use this in production.

The script uses a .png as input and converts its pixels to css in the form of a box-shadow.
You should reduce the size and number of colors from the image because the script really only converts pixels to css. As so, the less the better.

NOTE: It ignores the pixels with transparency.

## Usage:
// clone project
// get inside the project folder
npm install 
node pngtocss.js [input] [output] [className]

## Example of the output:

# Have fun!
